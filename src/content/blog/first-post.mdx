We started QRK with a simple observation: somewhere along the way, technology stopped being about making life better and started being about capturing attention, harvesting data, and optimising for metrics that have nothing to do with human wellbeing.

This is our attempt to do things differently.

## The Problem We See

Modern technology has given us incredible capabilities. We can connect with anyone, anywhere. We have access to the sum of human knowledge in our pockets. AI can generate art, write code, and solve complex problems.

> But capability without intention is dangerous. The same tools that connect us also isolate us. The same algorithms that surface relevant content also trap us in echo chambers. The same AI that augments our creativity also threatens to replace it.

We are not anti-technology. Far from it. We are engineers who have spent years building systems, writing code, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. But we have also seen how easily good intentions can go wrong when the underlying incentives are misaligned.

## What We Are Building

Our approach is simple:

1. **Start small** — We are not trying to change the world overnight. We are building focused tools that solve real problems for real people.

2. **Human-first design** — Every feature we build starts with a question: does this make someone's life genuinely better? If we cannot answer yes, we do not build it.

3. **Transparent trade-offs** — We believe in honest relationships with our users. No dark patterns. No hidden data collection. No engagement tricks.

## Our Technical Foundation

We work across the full stack, from frontend interfaces to backend infrastructure. Our toolkit includes:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Next.js
- **Backend**: Go, Rust, Python
- **Infrastructure**: Custom tooling, security systems, data pipelines

We have built everything from e-commerce platforms to intrusion detection systems. We know how to ship production software that scales.

## What Comes Next

We are just getting started. Over the coming months, we will be sharing:

- Deep dives into our development process
- Open source tools and libraries
- Research findings on human-centric technology
- Case studies from projects we are working on

We do not have all the answers. We are figuring this out as we go, learning from our mistakes, and trying to build something meaningful.

We are building in public, and we are building for you.
